# AWS Gateway Load Balancer Architecture with Terraform

This repository provisions a secure multi-VPC AWS infrastructure using Terraform. It includes the deployment of a Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) to route traffic between two VPCs — an "AWS Course VPC" and a "Security VPC" — through a centralized inspection appliance (e.g., firewall or monitoring EC2).
